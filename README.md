# Portfolio
A collection of various projects to showcase my skills.  Projects here are unlikely to be updated and stand as is.  Feel free to use code from them if you wish.

## Basic Python Coding

1.	Weather.py
Simple Python program that retrieves current weather conditions from an API for a city or zip code input by the user. 

2.	FiberOptic.py
Simple Python program that creates a sale receipt for a company purchasing a length of fiber optic cable. 


## R Statistics

3.	Exercise in Exploring Predictors of House Sale Prices Using a Linear Model
Exploring the relationship between house price and lot size and between price, year built, and lot size. Neither model was very good at explaining the variation with the sale price data. Square footage was a better predictor for house price than the year the house was built.

4.	Does Weather Impact Birdwatcher Participation and Chances of Observing a Wood Thrush? 
This study looks at how different weather aspects such as precipitation, temperature, and hurricanes affect bird observations both in terms of the number of checklists that are being submitted by birders to eBird and the success rate of observing a Wood Thrush in the northern part of the state of Florida. 


## Visuals

5.	Airline Safety Review
This project looks at the statistics and other numbers regarding the safety of airline travel and highlights the use of visualizations in presentations. 


## Data Mining

6.	Birdwatching During the Pandemic
Review project looking at whether the coronavirus pandemic impacted birdwatching popularity through several different sources including Google search trends, financial data, and participation numbers in citizen science.

7.	Car Crashes and Public Safety Analysis
Exercise in combining data from different sources and working with SQL datasets.  General exploration into car crash data, public safety spending, unemployment rate, population, and public transportation usage.


## Models

8.	The (Possible) Hidden Cost of Smoking on Insurance
This project attempts to estimate an insurance company's year-end medical charges from the data supplied when patrons sign up.  A second model attempts to estimate a possible hidden cost from patrons lying about their smoker status during sign-up. The second model is a possible additional lens to look at the results from the first model. 

9.	Handwritten Number Recognition Using a Neural Network
This project aims to build a neural network to recognize handwritten number images as their proper values. 

10.	Clustering ALS Characteristics
Using an anonymized data set on ALS patients, this exercise aims to determine if there are distinct clustering tendencies of the data characteristics using k-means clustering. 

11.	Predicting Almond Crop Yield
Group predictive analysis project trying to predict future almond crop yield based on a few different growing season factors to determine crop profitability. 

12.	Book Recommendation System
This project looks to create a recommender system in which a reader inputs the title of a book they liked, and the system will respond with recommendations for their next book to read.  The project explores and evaluates two methods for the recommendation: rating-based and content-based.

13.	Bird Photo Identification
This project aimed to create a model that could identify bird species shown in a photo.  The classification model created was around 78 percent accurate.

14.	Predicting the Monetary Value of Ecotourism
This project looked into characteristics of tourism in Tanzania and attempted to create a model that could predict potential income for local communities due to the tourism.  Although it was able to provide some potential marketing insights, the models created at best underestimated the potential tour costs and would require further improvement.
